This is my first portfolio built with advanced CSS techniques like Flexbox (and, tragically, no libraries or frameworks like Bootstrap). This includes links to my current actual portfolio, which hosts samples of my work and a resume in timeline format. 

The acceptance criteria asks for a recent photo or avatar, but Jung said to stay to the format used in class, which does not contain one. My work and contact info is linked. 

Links in nav are connected to corresponding section. 

You asked for the first application to be the biggest and boy howdy it sure is. Kinda wish I could get all of the images to be smaller. Can't. TA tried. Couldn't. Well, there you have it, I guess. All the images are also links to, which take the user to the deployed application (portfolio item).

Do I wish it looked better? Sure I do. But after spending four days on this, including the entirety of office hours in a one-on-one with the TA, I am now out of time. 

And if you want to know more about Amelia and the crabs, just say the word (if a human ever actually looks at this--I'm guessing it will just be run through the software for grading and that's it.)
